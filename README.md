# hacker-in-residence
[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewkonya/) am looking for an ambitious mercenary software engineer who wants to work directly with a [technical CEO](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9JlvqbQAAAAJ&hl=en).

**The ideal person?** You are pragmatic and enjoy rapid prototyping. You can build nearly anything from scratch but take more pride in using frameworks, libraries, and tools to build things FAST. You see short cuts as strength, not weakness. You've independently built a wide range of cool things and may have won a hackathon. You are deeply entrepreneurial and may already be thinking about starting your own company. 

**The role?** Work with the CEO to identify and independently execute high impact week-scale engineering projects — from custom tools and clever integrations to moonshot prototypes and data explorations. You will work hard, build cool things, and have a massive impact. Along the way, you will learn a physicist's approach to building and scaling a VC-backed tech company.

**The company?** Remesh was founded in 2014 to give communities a collectively intelligent voice. Our product uses machine learning to scale the open-ended dynamics of live 1-to-1 conversation to a statistically relevant N-to-1 paradigm. It is used by the worlds largest brands, consultancies, governments, and NGOs to engage and understand customers, employees, citizens, and populations. Our business has grown over 2x every year and we've raised $40m+ in funding. We are now a team of 100+ of the worlds most talented pragmatic altruists.

**Requirements:**

1. 3+ years of full stack building/prototyping for personal or professional applications
2. 5+ independant projects, hackathons, or otherwise entreprenurial builds
3. Proficient in 1+ open source development framework (Django, Node.js, etc)
4. Proficient in 1+ front end framework (React, ViewJS, etc)
5. Proficient in python and JavaScript
6. Proficient in SQL (or equivalent)
7. Proficient in Jupyter notebooks 
8. Working knowledge of git or equivalent VCS

**Bonus:**

1. Wizard at Mathematica
2. Knows the dark arts of ETL and BI platforms like Sisense, Tableau
3. Comfortable with baysian statistics
4. Suprisingly good design chops
5. Can work magic with D3
6. Experience with NumPy, Keras, Tensorflow, Torch, etc

**Benifits:**
1. Work-from-anywhere 
2. Competitive comp
2. Solid medical/dental/vision coverage
3. 401K plan
